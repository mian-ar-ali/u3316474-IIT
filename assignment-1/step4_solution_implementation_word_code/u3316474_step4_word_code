STEP 4 – Implementing the Solution (Word Coding)
1.	System Initialization
•	Turn system ON.
2.	Feeding Time Check
•	If F-TIME = FALSE, then wait until F-TIME = TRUE.
•	If F-TIME = TRUE, proceed to next step.
3.	Food Level Check
•	If F-LEVEL = FALSE (i.e., food level ≤ 15 cm), then:
•	Set DISPENSE = FALSE.
•	Send ALERT_F-LEVEL: "Food Level low. Please fill tank."
•	Wait for next F-TIME = TRUE.
•	Else if F-LEVEL = TRUE (food level is sufficient):
•	Set DISPENSE = TRUE.
•	Activate servo motor to dispense food.
4.	Wait Period
•	Wait for 10 minutes.
5.	Food Bowl Weight Check
•	If F-WEIGHT = FALSE (i.e., weight ≤ 150g), then:
•	Send ALERT_F-WEIGHT: "Pet didn't eat sufficient amount of food. Pet monitoring advised."
•	Else:
•	Proceed.
6.	Auto-Off Check
•	If AUTO-OFF = TRUE, then turn system OFF.
•	Else, wait for next F-TIME = TRUE.
